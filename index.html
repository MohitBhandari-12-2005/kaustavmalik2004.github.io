<h4>In the national capital of India, that s Delhi is more the 12% of vehicles have been stolen in Delhi, in 2018, which becomes an economical loss to the owner. The rate of stealing vehicles in our national capital is five vehicles every hour, on the other hand some children steal their parents vehicles key and drive the vehicle rashly and often cause accidents hurting themselves as well as the ones, whom they have hit and it becomes a problem  for the parents.
<br>
So to prevent this here is my prototype. In this prototype, there is a fingerprint sensor in which my fingerprint is stored. As I keep my finger on the fingerprint sensor it checks, if the fingerprint matches with the fingerprint stored, then it passes the control to the camera, which perform the face recognition. In that the authorized personï¿½s face is stored and the camera will scan our face and if it matches with face stored in it, then only the motor starts. The same process can be implemented by removing the key and the auto-ignition part of the vehicle
<br>
By adding this system the security of our vehicle will be secured at a higher level of security. Our daily life will be much easier. There will be no tension of misplacing the key of the vehicle and giving a kick start to the motorcycles. We have only just to place our finger on the fingerprint sensor, scan our face and if all those security steps satisfies, the vehicle would start and we can enjoy our ride.
